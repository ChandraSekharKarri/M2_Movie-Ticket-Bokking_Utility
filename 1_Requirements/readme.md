THE USER REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

INTRODUCTION

Employees are the backbone of any company, management of employee performance plays a major role in
deciding the success of the organization. The workshop is situated in Rwanda has a problem in
management of employee performance. The current system running in the workshop is paper based. That
is the workshop is still using cabinet files to store records of stock and employee information. Useful data
is scattered all over the place. In this chapter we shall discuss the solutions to the problems being caused by
the current system. We shall try to understand the manager’s expectations of the new system we are to
develop for him.

DATA COLLECTION

A questionnaire in the form of a survey was used to gather information. Why a survey??The database
program proposed for this project is based on an automobile repair shop in Rwanda. So similar businesses’
in South Africa and were surveyed to find out how they managed their employees. I asked them to
respond to a few questions.Their responsesto the questions are summarised in Appendix A. These were
used to compare with the responses from the workshop in Rwanda.

PROBLEM DOMAIN

The problem domain is the computerisation of an employee management system that can be accessed
online by the administrator and the stakeholders such as the manager.

THE CURRENT SYSTEM

People have different personalities and work ethics .So in order to manage their work efficiently and fairly,
there has to be a system in place to allocate tasks to different workers. Currently a manual system is used in
the Rwandan business that will provide most of the requirements for this project. The system used in
Rwanda is based on “TRUST” the employer trusts the employees. Althoughnoble the manager has little it
control over his business. In a manual system data is stored in a cabinet. Files are thus often misplaced or
lost. And at times is difficult to find relevant files. Records for stocks are also not always filed correctly and
thus information is not centralised and not easily accessible.

EXPECTATIONS FOR THE NEW SYSTEM:

The systemshould be:
 Secure.
 The system should be able to provide a list of the employees, the times they worked, the tasks they
have been doing etc.
 The system must be able to list what is currently in stock.
 The system must provide easy access to employees’details (name, id number, employee number,
address).

CONCLUSION

This chapter dealt with the user’s needs and expectations for the new system. The next chapter deals
with requirements analysis that is requirements needed to solve the problem being faced by the
workshop in Rwanda. An employee management system will be the best solution for the problem. It
will provide easy online access to the employees that are currently at work and what they are working
on. Also easy to allocate jobs to the employees that are done with what they were doing. The system
will provide quick and reliable access to the running of the business saving the manager a whole lot of
time and money
