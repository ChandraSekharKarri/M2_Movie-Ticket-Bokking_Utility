<h1>Employee Management System
  
<h2>Design Methodology
  
<h3>The researcher consulted the administration
department of the company for which the system is
being developed. This consultation was for the
purpose of studying the system in detail to
understand its functionality and requirement in the
new system and probably introduce new features
that will establish an improved system. Various
tables were designed showing the data to be
captured, the flow chart system for the program was
developed. From this flow chart, the software
program for the data capture of each employee was
developed and test run in order to make sure it
performs the function for which it was so developed
